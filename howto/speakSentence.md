{% extendmethod %}

### Create Call Parameters

| Property    | Description                            |
|:------------|:---------------------------------------|
| from | A Bandwidth phone number on your account the call should come from (must be in E.164 format, like +19195551212). |

{% common %}

### Example of creating a call with callbackUrl

{% sample lang="http" %}

```http
POST https://api.catapult.inetwork.com/v1/users/{userId}/calls HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Authorization: {apiToken:apiSecret}

{
    "to"          : "{toNumber}",
    "from"        : "{fromNumber}",
    "callbackUrl" : "{callbackUrl}"
}
```

{% sample lang="js" %}

```js
//This assumes you have already input your credentials.
client.Call.create({
    from: "{toNumber}",
    to: "{fromNumber}",
    callbackUrl: "{callbackUrl}"
})
.then(function (id) {
    console.log(id);
})
```

{% sample lang="csharp" %}

```csharp
//This assumes you have already input your credentials.
var call = await client.Call.CreateAsync(new CreateCallData{
    From = "{fromNumber}",
    To = "{toNumber}"
    CallbackUrl = "{callbackUrl}"
});
Console.WriteLine($"Created call with id {call.Id}");
```

{% sample lang="ruby" %}

```ruby
## This assumes you have already input your credentials.
call = Bandwidth::Call.create({
   :from => "{fromNumber}",
   :to => "{toNumber}",
   :callbackUrl => "{requestUrl}"})

puts call.id
```

{% endextendmethod %}

## Step 2 {#hotlink-to-step2} - Check if call is answered

{% extendmethod %}

In order to speak a sentence on a call, the call must be answered. When the call is answered, Bandwidth will notify the callbackUrl with an eventType = "answer". Once we recieve this callback, we can procede with speak sentence.

### Example of callback answer event

json response

```http
POST /your_url HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
User-Agent: BandwidthAPI/v1

{
    "eventType" : "answer",
    "from"      : "{toNumber}",
    "to"        : "{fromNumber}",
    "callId"    : "{callId}",
    "callUri"   : "{callUri}",
    "callState" : "active",
    "time"      : "date"
}
```

{% endextendmethod %}

## Step 3 {#hotlink-to-step3} - Speak sentence on call
